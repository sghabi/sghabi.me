  Hi there ! 
  I'm Sonia, a 27 years old french currently living in Singapore.
  I'm a software engineer who has worked mostly on back end (Java/J2EE and C#/.NET), but trying to learn more about 
  fullstack technologies. This website is implemented using React and Node.js.
  Feel free to try the different features of this website, everything you think is clickable actually is :).
